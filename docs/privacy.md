# Website Privacy Policy

[Accellera Systems Initiative](https://accellera.org) is committed to protecting your online privacy on our websites, including but not limited to our site accessible at [accellera.org](https://accellera.org). The privacy practices described in this privacy policy apply to [accellera.org](https://accellera.org) and to all of our websites (collectively, the "Site"). This privacy policy does not cover any other data collection or processing, including, without limitation, data collection practices of global sponsors or other websites to which we link or data that we or our affiliates collect offline or through web pages that do not display a direct link to this privacy policy.

Some of the reasons why we collect your personal information include:

* Register to access certain parts of the Site
* Register to attend events
* Register to view videos and other promotions
* Register to subscribe to newsletters and community notifications
* Participate in discussion forums
* Register to download standards and draft document

We occasionally employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing and technical assistance, and processing membership fees. These third party service providers have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. We do not sell, rent, share, or otherwise disclose personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes.

## Collection of Personally Identifiable Information

### Registration

In order to use certain protected areas of the Site, you first must complete a registration form and create a user ID and password. During registration you are required to give contact information (such as name and email address).

Registration may also be required to attend events, view videos, respond to surveys, and enter contests. These are separate from the Site registration and do not establish a user account on the Site. You are required to give contact information (such as name and email address), but are not required to create a user ID and password.

## Collection of Non-Personally Identifiable Information

### Log Files

As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, file downloads, and license acceptance.

We use this information to analyze trends, to administer the Site, to track users' movements around the Site, to enhance your experience in using our Site, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. This information is used to better understand and improve the usability, performance, and effectiveness of the Site.

### Cookies

Some web pages use "cookies," which are small files saved on your computer. Cookies help us recognize your user preferences and can improve your future web visits. You can set your web browser to notify you when you are receiving a cookie and choose to reject it. However, rejecting cookies may affect the performance of the Site and prevent you from accessing certain Accellera Systems Initiative information.

## Communications

### Working Group and Event-related Announcements

We may occasionally send you information on important Accellera Systems Initiative technical advancements and events that might be of interest to you.

Out of respect for your privacy, we present the option not to receive these types of communications. Please see [Choice and Opt-Out](#choice-and-opt-out) below.

### Newsletters

We will occasionally use your name and email address to send newsletters to you. Out of respect for your privacy, we provide you a way to unsubscribe. Please see [Choice and Opt-Out](#choice-and-opt-out) below.

## Information Sharing and Disclosure

### Personally Identifiable Information

In addition to any sharing of personally identifiable information otherwise detailed in this policy, we may occasionally share personally identifiable information with third parties acting as either agents or service providers acting on our behalf.

### Site Registration

When you register to use the Site, we may use this information to contact you about the services on our Site in which you have expressed interest. We do not share this information other than as necessary to enable subcontractors to provide you with the services of the Site or otherwise as you have requested.

### Event Registration

If you register for an event (whether sponsored by, organized by, or otherwise related to Accellera Systems Initiative, including third-party events for which Accellera Systems Initiative provides a registration mechanism) on or in connection with the Site, the information you provide may be shared with the sponsors of the event and other Accellera Systems Initiative sponsors, and the use of your personal information will be subject to the relative applicable privacy policies.

### Video Viewing Registration

Registration may be required to view videos posted on the Site. As with events, the information you provide in connection with such registration may be shared with the sponsors of the video and/or other Accellera Systems Initiative sponsors, and their use of your personal information will be subject to the relative applicable privacy policies.

### Surveys or Contests

From time to time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on the Site or at a meeting. If you participate, we may request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code).

We use this information to notify contest winners and award prizes, and sometimes to send participants an email newsletter if requested.

In some cases, we may use a third-party service provider to conduct these surveys or contests; any such provider is subject to the limitations of this policy.

### Agents & Service Providers

We use third parties to process membership fees and provide certain specific services on the Site, such as registration for certain events.

When you sign up for these particular services, we may share your personal information as necessary with authorized third-party agents or contractors in order to provide the requested service or transaction.

We only provide third-party agents and service providers with the minimum amount of personal information necessary to complete the requested service or transaction. We do not permit these companies to share or use personally identifiable information for any other purposes.

### Legal Disclaimer

We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on the Site. Also, we reserve the right to fully use and disclose any information collected via the Site that is not in a personally identifiable form.

### Links to Other Sites

This Site contains links to other websites that are not owned or controlled by Accellera Systems Initiative. Please be aware Accellera Systems Initiative is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other websites.
