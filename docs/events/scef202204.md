**Workshop on the Evolution of SystemC Standards**

In 2022 we are continuing the SystemC Evolution with the smaller, regular, online workshops. We refer to these workshops as *fikas*, to honor the fika tradition of sharing a coffee, slowing down a bit, and talking about things that we care about.

## Event information

Date: **7 April 2022**<br>

## Program: Parallelization of SystemC simulations

The main topic for this SystemC Fika is to discuss the various parallelization approaches of SystemC simulations and what needs to be incorporated in future versions of the SystemC standard.
