## Workshop on the Evolution of SystemC Standards

The SystemC Evolution Fika is a series of online workshops to discuss the latest SystemC developments and applications. We refer to these workshops as *fikas*, to honor the fika tradition of sharing a coffee, slowing down a bit, and talking about things that we care about.

## Abstracts

### SystemC IEEE 1666 update

*Presenter: Jérôme Cornet, STMicroelectronics, IEEE P1666 Chair*

The next revision of IEEE 1666 SystemC is coming! It builds on enhancements and features contributed by the SystemC community during the last decade through the Accellera SystemC Language Working Group. This session will present some of the features of the upcoming revision, which modernize the language and enable new use cases.

### Tracing in SystemC

*Presenters: Lukas Jünger, MachineWare GmbH; Eyck Jentzsch, Rocco Jonack, MINRES Technologies*

The proper capture, storage, and visualization of simulation data, encompassing simulation results, traces, and meta-information, represent essential requirements for nearly all SystemC users. However, the absence of a vendor-independent, open standard has thus far impeded the seamless integration of SystemC models into complex virtual platforms, as it prevents a unified solution especially for simulation result analysis.
This presentation proposes a solution to address this challenge. By establishing a standardized approach to capture and store simulation data, we aim to enable unified visualization and analysis. This advancement will unite the capabilities of diverse SystemC models within a coherent framework, fostering a more streamlined and efficient simulation experience for all users.

### SystemC Data Types

*Presenter: Andy Goodrich, Accellera Allied Member*

A rewrite of the SystemC arbitrary-width integer support has been done to improve performance. The new version uses twos-complement representation rather than sign-magnitude, and contains a new storage scheme for values. This presentation describes the changes made, and provides some benchmark results.
