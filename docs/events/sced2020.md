**Workshop on the Evolution of SystemC Standards**<br>
**Thursday, October 29, 2020**<br>
**Virtual Online Workshop**

The fifth SystemC Evolution Day was a full-day, technical workshop on the evolution of SystemC standards to advance the SystemC ecosystem. In several in-depth sessions, selected current and future standardization topics around SystemC will be discussed in order to accelerate their progress for inclusion in Accellera/IEEE standards.

SystemC Evolution Day is intended as a lean, user-centric, hands-on forum bringing together experts from the SystemC user community and the Accellera Working Groups to advance SystemC standards.

Date: 29 October 2020 (day after DVCon Europe 2020)<br>
Time: 8:30 - 19:30 CET<br>
Location: Virtual Online Workshop

## Organization Team:

## SystemC Evolution Day Goes Virtual

*by Ola Dahl*

Entering the digital conference era, the Accellera SystemC Evolution Day 2020 will follow the example set by DVCon Europe, and become a virtual event. This will make things different, of course, but it will also enable new possibilities.

The overall intent remains: We want to gather the SystemC community, and we want interesting presentations and creative discussions and debates, advancing the standards.

Our call for contributions closed on July 10, 2020. As stated in the call for contributions, we welcomed “contributions on ideas for additions and improvements to SystemC and its further standardization." For the choice of topic, you might want to relate to ongoing activities in Accellera working groups, covering the “SystemC language, Transaction level Modeling (TLM), Configuration, Control & Inspection (CCI), Analog/Mixed Signal (AMS), High-level Synthesis (HLS), and Verification”. We will post the full agenda soon - stay tuned!

We are eager to hear about your insights from own projects, applications and studies, as well as continuations and follow-ups from previous System Evolution Days. Looking back at previous events (we had SystemC Evolution Days in 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019), you might want to pick a topic that has been on the agenda before, or you might want to bring in fresh insights and new angles on SystemC.

Regarding how the actual workshop will be run, we are working on that, together with the DVCon Europe Steering Committee – stay tuned, and more info will follow.

For additional inspiration, you might want to have a look at topics from earlier years, as presented by tagcrowd – based on a personal (and clearly unscientific) summary from the presentation material:
