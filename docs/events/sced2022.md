# SystemC Evolution Day 2022 <img style="float: right; width:300px;" src="/images/SCED-2022-Logo-500px.png">

**Workshop on the Evolution of SystemC Standards, held on 8 December 2022**

The seventh SystemC Evolution Day is a full-day, technical workshop on the evolution of SystemC standards to advance the SystemC ecosystem. In several in-depth sessions, selected current and future standardization topics around SystemC will be discussed in order to accelerate their progress for inclusion in Accellera/IEEE standards.

SystemC Evolution Day is intended as a lean, user-centric, hands-on forum bringing together experts from the SystemC user community and the Accellera Working Groups to advance SystemC standards.

## Event information

Date: **8 December 2022** (day after DVCon Europe 2022)<br>

## Organization Team:

 * Martin Barnasconi, NXP
 * Jerome Cornet, STMicroelectronics
 * Christian Sauer, Cadence
 * Mark Burton, Qualcomm
 * Peter de Jager, Intel

## Program

The main theme this year is **Evolution and Ecosystem**: Besides the developments of the SystemC standard and its implementations, we like to broaden our view to see and learn how SystemC is used, or could be used, in other system modeling and simulation environments around us.

Exploring this bigger ecosystem, and understanding the role of SystemC in such ecosystem, is vital to identify new requirements and features to be developed as part of the SystemC ecosystem or beyond, by means of adapters, interfaces or other intercommunication concepts.

The (tentative) program of the SystemC Evolution Day will cover the following topics:

* Introduction – Evolution and Ecosystem
* SystemC standardization in IEEE
* Accellera update
* Virtualization and Emulation with QEMU and SystemC
* Distributed simulation and SystemC
* Panel & Discussion – System modeling and simulation - now and in the future
