# SystemC Evolution Day 2022 <img style="float: right; width:300px;" src="/images/SCED-2022-Logo-500px.png">

**Workshop on the Evolution of SystemC Standards, held on 8 December 2022**

The seventh SystemC Evolution Day is a full-day, technical workshop on the evolution of SystemC standards to advance the SystemC ecosystem. In several in-depth sessions, selected current and future standardization topics around SystemC will be discussed in order to accelerate their progress for inclusion in Accellera/IEEE standards.

SystemC Evolution Day is intended as a lean, user-centric, hands-on forum bringing together experts from the SystemC user community and the Accellera Working Groups to advance SystemC standards.

## Event information

Date: **8 December 2022** (day after DVCon Europe 2022)<br>

 * Ola Dahl, Ericsson (Chair)
 * Martin Barnasconi, NXP
 * Jerome Cornet, STMicroelectronics
 * Christian Sauer, Cadence
 * Mark Burton, Qualcomm
 * Peter de Jager, Intel

## Call for Presentations

Submit your contribution reflecting experiences in deploying SystemC in models, tools, flows and methodologies. Example areas of interest include:

 * Virtual Prototyping for embedded software
 * High Level Synthesis
 * System modelling for analog/mixed-signal and RF
 * Pre-silicon power modelling
 * SystemC for system-level verification and validation
 * System architecture modelling
 * SystemC standardization needs across a particular application domain, such as automotive
 * SystemC usage together with other system simulation technologies, such as QEMU, FMU/FMI

A contribution can be in the form of a finding, a result, or a proposal, but also a problem experienced that you feel needs attention and discussion in an Accellera and SystemC user-community context.

At the SystemC Evolution Day, we expect you to present the contribution using slides, and to be prepared and ready to engage in debate and discussion.

Please submit a 200-500 word outline of your contribution, using the e-mail address
