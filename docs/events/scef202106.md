## Presentation Abstracts

### SystemC and QEMU

*Presenter: Mark Burton, Greensocs*

Whats in the QBox?

QEMU and SystemC has been a topic of conversation for some years, with good reason. QEMU is probably the best known ‘de facto standard’ virtualiser, while SystemC is “the standard language to build virtual platforms” - both of them are “open source” - they should live together, right?

Well, we’re now on at least the 3rd generation of integrations between the two, and things are beginning to work quite well!

QEMU is fast, really fast, and with the advent of MTTCG (Thanks to GreenSocs), it’s multi-core and fast. It also covers a huge range of architectures and devices.

We will talk about how QEMU works, and the possibilities for integration with SystemC; we’ll touch on synchronisation (and how to make sure it works with all external simulators); and we’ll also look at some use cases where QEMU itself is now able to ‘give answers’ that previously required much more detailed modelling.

### Panel: SystemC Modeling Libraries

*Panelists:*

 * Lukas Jünger, Greensocs
 * Rocco Jonack, Arteris
 * Eyck Jentzsch, MINRES Technologies
 * Laurent Maillet-Contoz, STMicroelectronics

A panel discussing libraries for modeling and simulation, with the goal to exchange ideas and look for commonalities that could be of interest as common shared libraries and/or future standardization work at Accellera. 

Topics include, but are not limited to:

 * Utilities for simulators, like logging, tracing, debugging
 * Tools and frameworks for simulator configuration, including model instantiations and model connections
 * Class libraries for certain model components, model types and protocols
