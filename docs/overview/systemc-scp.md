# SystemC Common Practices (SCP) 


The SystemC Common Practices project provides peer-reviewed, standards compliant, basic infrastructure that you can use in your SystemC projects.

The emphasis is to show how the other SystemC standards can best be used, and provide a common set of basic components.

Each component in the SCP project can be used individually, or they may be used together. The intention is that all components are interoperable and work on standard SystemC simulators.

The SCP working group meets regularly and the SCP project is updated frequently with new contributions. If you have some code you think others would find useful, please be in touch!
