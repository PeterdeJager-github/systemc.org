# List of project ideas for GSoC 2023
<br>
[Accellera Systems Initiative][1] applied as mentoring organization in [Google Summer of Code][2] (GSoC). This page lists the (draft) project ideas suggested by Accellera for GSoC. As Accellera is not yet an accepted mentoring organization, the proposals are not finalized and detailed. The final list of suggested project ideas will be made available end of February 2023.  We encourage contributors to the GSoC to review these proposals and contact us to discuss these further by email: gsoc[at]lists.accellera.org 

All proposals are based on the use of [SystemC][3], which is a C++ class library providing an event-driven and transaction-level simulation interface to create system-level models of hardware and software at multiple levels of abstraction. SystemC has been released by the IEEE Standards Association as [IEEE 1666-2011][4] - the SystemC Language Reference Manual (LRM). The Accellera Systems Initiative maintains the [SystemC reference implementation][5] providing an open-source proof-of-concept simulator. SystemC has found its way in many industry supported electronics design automation (EDA) tools and technologies, listed [here][12].

## GSoC 2023 Idea List (draft)

 * SystemC regression infrastructure
 * SystemC reference implementation upgrade
 * SystemC virtual model of a System-on-a-Chip
 * Federated Simulation including SystemC

### SystemC regression infrastructure

The idea is to improve the regression infrastructure for the [SystemC reference implementation][5]. this includes improving the existing build flows (Automake and CMake) and introduce a predictive testing and release process following Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD). 

*More details will follow*

### SystemC reference implementation upgrade

The idea is to upgrade the existing [SystemC reference implementation][5] by using modern C++17 language constructs and features. The SystemC language itself has been standardized by IEEE Std. 1666 and documented in the Language Reference Manual, which is currently being renewed. As C++17 is the new baseline for the upcoming SystemC standard, the public API of the reference implementation should be made compatible with this new standard, and there is also an opportunity to update the implementation-specific simulation kernel.

*More details will follow*

### SystemC virtual model of a System-on-a-Chip

The idea is to develop a SystemC virtual model to demonstrate the capabilities of the SystemC language standard to create a system-level model of a System-on-a-Chip (SoC). The SystemC virtual model might use additional SystemC libraries such as [SystemC-AMS][6] (Analog/Mixed-Signal), [CCI][7] (Configuration, Control and Inspection), [UVM-SystemC][8] (Universal Verification Methodology in SystemC) or other C/C++ language features to demonstrate the capabilities of using an executable virtual model. 

*More details will follow*

### Federated simulation including SystemC 

Federated simulation targets an efficient integration and orchestration of multiple system-level models and their execution semantics into one unified system simulation. It should facilitate multi-domain simulation where different models-of-computation are integrated and synchronized. Various initiatives in different industries have been started targeting Federated simulation and standardization, such as the Simulation Model Portability ([SMP2][9]) and the Functional Mock-up Interface ([FMI][10]). The idea is to demonstrate how SystemC Transaction Level Modeling ([TLM][11]) can be used and interact with these other standardized simulation interfaces.
