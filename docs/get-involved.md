[systemc.org][5] is maintained by the SystemC Working Groups at [Accellera Systems Initiative][1].

## Join Accellera Systems Initiative

[Accellera Systems Initiative][1] is an independent, not-for profit organization dedicated to create, support, promote, and advance system-level design, modeling, and verification standards for use by the worldwide electronics industry. We are composed of a [broad range of members][2] that fully support the work of our [technical committee][3] to develop technology standards that are balanced, open, and benefit the worldwide electronics industry. Leading companies and semiconductor manufacturers around the world are using our electronic design automation (EDA) and intellectual property (IP) standards in a wide range of projects in numerous application areas to develop consumer, mobile, wireless, automotive, and other “smart” electronic devices. Through an ongoing partnership with the IEEE, standards and technical implementations developed by Accellera Systems Initiative are contributed to the IEEE for formal standardization and ongoing governance.

More information on how to join Accellera can be found [here][6].

## Google Summer of Code 2023

Accellera Systems Initiative applied as mentoring organization in [Google Summer of Code][8] (GSoC). Google Summer of Code is a global, online program focused on bringing new contributors into open source software development. Accellera is suggesting a list of project ideas which can be found [here][9]. We encourage contributors to the GSoC to review these proposals and contact us to discuss these further by email: gsoc[at]lists.accellera.org 

## Join the Accellera SystemC Working Groups

Accellera's [SystemC Working Groups][4] are responsible for the definition and development of the SystemC Core and Transaction Level Modeling (TLM) language, including extensions for analog/mixed-signal (AMS), control, configuration, and inspection (CCI), sythesis and verification. Participants of these working groups include member companies and industry contributors. Technical contributors typically have many years of practical experience with IC and system-level design as well as developing system-level design methodologies and using EDA tools.

If your organization is a member of Accellera Systems Initiative, you can sign up for [Member Employee access][7] and start participating in the [Accellera Working Groups][4].
